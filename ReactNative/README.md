# React Native Expo

## Run on iOS simulator

- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn ios`

# Ease of getting started

- Setup through the CLI is straight forward
- Boilerplate Typescript intellisense is a bit off initially

# Developer support (open source, community, documentation)

- Big open source community

# Developer experience (native support, debugging, flexibility)

- Need to be sure the Typescript interfaces are accurate, otherwise you might shoot yourself in the foot
- Expo provides slightly better out of the box solutions compared to barebones `react-native`

## Hot Reloading

- Default triggers on file save
